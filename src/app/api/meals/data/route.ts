/**
 * PUT /api/meals/data — partial update.
 *
 * Every field in the body is optional. Omitted fields are preserved from the
 * existing on-disk data, so callers can write only what they actually changed:
 *   - meals modal sends `{ savedMeals, plan }` (settings preserved)
 *   - settings sheets send `{ settings }` (meals/plan/groceries preserved)
 *   - a whole set of grocery ticks sends `{ groceryChecked }` (one tick at a
 *     time goes through `POST /api/meals/grocery`)
 *
 * Required: at least one writable field must be present (otherwise the request
 * is a no-op and returns 400). Each present field must be a valid type.
 *
 * A write of `savedMeals` or `plan` replaces that array whole, so it has to
 * quote the `revision` it was built from (see `mealRevision`). One built from
 * an older copy comes back as a 409 carrying what is stored now, with
 * `reason: 'revision'` so the client can tell it from the empty-overwrite
 * guard's 409, re-apply its edit to the fresh copy and try again.
 *
 * The empty-overwrite guard runs whenever `savedMeals` OR `plan` is being
 * written — previously it only ran when both were present, which let a
 * `{ savedMeals: [] }` request wipe the meal library without the guard
 * firing. Settings-only and grocery-only writes still bypass the guard
 * because they can't touch savedMeals/plan.
 *
 * The entire read-modify-write cycle runs inside `updateMealData`, which
 * serializes through the json-store write queue. This prevents cross-surface
 * writers (editor settings, /remote, grocery checks, migration) from
 * interleaving and silently losing each other's edits.
