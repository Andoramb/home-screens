/**
 * Which of an update's system changes leave the wall out of date until the

 * Every install ends with `scripts/upgrade.sh setup-system`, which brings the
 * Pi's own configuration in line with the new release and reports what it
 * changed on its last line, as `{"ok":true,"changed":"launcher,packages"}`
 * (or `"changed":null`). Most of those changes take effect by themselves, or
 * only matter at the next boot anyway (the boot splash, kernel options,
 * swap). A few are read once, when the kiosk session starts, and the running
 * wall keeps the old ones until the Pi restarts. A feature that depends on
 * them quietly does nothing in the meantime: that is how "switch the
 * screen's power off" first reached a household, doing nothing until they
 * happened to reboot.
