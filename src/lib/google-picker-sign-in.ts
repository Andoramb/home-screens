/**
 * Sending people straight back to the hub after a Google Photos sign-in.
 *
 * Google only ever returns to https://homescreens.dev/connect/google. With
 * Home Screens' own Google app switched on (HS_GOOGLE_HOSTED), each sign-in
 * link also carries the hub's own address in `state`, and that page forwards
 * the code to the hub's /editor/connect/google when the address is on a home
 * network, so nobody has to copy a code.
 *
 * A hub page that redeemed whatever code a link carried would let anyone
 * connect their own Google account to someone else's hub, so each link also
 * carries a one-time value, checked when the code comes back, and PKCE:
 * Google refuses the code without this hub's verifier, which never leaves the
 * hub. One sign-in waits at a time, in memory, for 10 minutes; a restart or
 * a newer sign-in means signing in again.
 *
 * `state` is `<one-time value>.<base64url(hub address)>`, or the one-time
 * value alone when the hub's address could not be confirmed. The website's
 * forwarding rule (website/src/lib/hub-return.ts) reads the same format.
