 *
 * Removal takes the person out of both and drops a chore that removal left
 * with nobody. A chore that goes to a group is never dropped: its
 * `assigneeIds` is empty by design, and the group itself is pruned on the
 * family list. Neither is a chore that already had nobody, which is what a
 * removed group leaves behind until someone is picked for it.
 * A schedule left with one person and no group collapses back to a fixed
 * rotation on that person's days (see `settleSchedule`).
 *
 * Restore refuses a chore that names a missing person or group rather than
 * guessing who should do it: the restore is stopped with every such record
 * listed.
