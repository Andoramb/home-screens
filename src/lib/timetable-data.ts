/**
 * School timetables: `data/timetables.json`.
 *
 * One document holds every school's bell schedule, the subject list everyone
 * shares, and one week grid per person. The editor loads it whole and saves it
 * whole, so a save quotes the revision it started from and is refused when
 * somebody else saved first, the same way the family list works.
 *
 * A timetable names a person by `memberId` and holds nothing else about them,
 * so the family roster stays the one place a name, colour or picture lives.
 * Member ids are checked against that roster on every save, inside the same
 * coordinator section as the write, so nobody can be removed between the check
 * and the file landing.
 *
 * A household that has never saved gets the subject catalogue for its
 * language to paint with. That default is handed out by `readTimetables`
 * only: nothing is written until the first real save.
