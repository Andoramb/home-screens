/**
 * Reading a school timetable out of a Google Sheet.
 *
 * Schools hand out timetables as spreadsheets, so the fastest way into the
 * module is to let a household paste the link it already has instead of typing
 * a grid by hand. This file is the whole server side of that: work out what
 * was pasted, list the tabs, download one tab as CSV, and turn its rows into
 * periods, breaks and lessons. No route and no UI live here.
 *
 * Three rules shape it:
 *
 * - **The server builds every URL it fetches.** The pasted text is only ever
 *   read for an id and a tab number; nothing we fetch comes from it directly,
 *   so a link to somewhere else cannot send the hub there.
 * - **A tab is addressed by gid, never by name.** Google's older `gviz`
 *   endpoint answers a tab name it does not recognise with the *first* tab and
 *   a cheerful 200, which would quietly import the wrong child's week. `gviz`
 *   is not used here at all: on a real school timetable it also dropped 24 of
 *   54 rows and invented its own header row and data range.
 *   `export?format=csv&gid=` is the only reader.
 * - **No sentences.** Failures come back as message keys the editor looks up
 *   in the household's own language, the way a calendar feed check does.
 *
 * The tab list comes from an undocumented block in Google's no-JS fallback
 * page, one `items.push({ name, gid })` per tab, present on `htmlview` for a
 * normal share link and on `pubhtml` for a publish-to-web link. That is an
 * internal detail rather than an API, so the fields are read independently of
 * their order, and "the page was read but carried no tab list" is its own
 * outcome rather than a failure: the household can still paste one link per
 * tab, which is the same screen either way.
