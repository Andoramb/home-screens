/**
 * Weather facts published on the shared-state bus, so modules and display
 * rules can react to the sky: "show the Rain Map only when rain is likely
 * today", a Text token like `{weather.temperature}`, a rule that jumps to a
 * weather screen when a storm is coming.
 *
 * Published by `useSharedDisplayData`, the display-level fetch, from the
 * household's default weather provider. That fetch already runs on every
 * display with a location (the event bus needs it), so the values exist
 * whether or not a weather module is placed and survive screen rotation. A
 * module pointed at a different provider is a render-time choice and
 * deliberately does not change what is published, for the same reason the
 * calendar producer ignores per-module filters: two producers would disagree
 * about what "today's chance of rain" is.
 *
 * Lifecycle, same as `calendar-state.ts`: while weather is being fetched,
 * EVERY key is published on every tick, blank when the provider does not
 * send the field it comes from. Publishing blank rather than clearing keeps
 * display rules armed (`advanceRuleEngine` refuses an `unknown -> true` edge
 * on a key that only just became known). A blank value fails a numeric
 * condition, which is what "the provider gave no chance of rain" should do.
 *
 * Clearing is reserved for "nothing is fetched": no location configured,
 * so there is no payload at all.
