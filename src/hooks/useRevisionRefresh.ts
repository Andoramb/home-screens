/**
 * Re-reads the wall's cached answers for one kind of data when the hub says
 * that data changed, instead of waiting for the reads' own poll.
 *
 * Each answer says which revision it was read at, and every heartbeat names
 * the current one; an answer that is behind is re-read. Comparing each answer
 * with the revision it was read at, rather than with the first beat this page
 * saw, also catches a change made while the wall was starting up. An answer
 * stays until a re-read replaces it, so one whose re-read failed is still
 * behind on the next beats and is asked for again; one no card is showing is
 * dropped instead, and read fresh when one does.
 *
 * A new revision is acted on once it has held for a whole beat. A phone
 * sending twelve photos one after another moves the library's twelve times,
 * and every re-read that comes back a different length restarts the slideshow
 * from its first picture, so the wall waits for the burst to end and re-reads
 * once.
