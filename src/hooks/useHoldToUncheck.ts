 * instant tap.
 *
 * One hold at a time, and it belongs to the pointer that began it.
 *
 * Two fingers land on a wall like this constantly, so the hold in flight is
 * tracked by `pointerId`: only the finger that started a hold can finish it,
 * and only on the row it started on. A second finger arriving mid-hold neither
 * takes the hold over nor inherits the time already spent on it, because both
 * would un-tick a chore nobody deliberately held. It is told why nothing
 * happened, and can hold for itself as soon as the first hold ends. The
 * alternative, cancelling the running hold, would let any passing touch break
 * a deliberate gesture, which is the thing this exists to protect.
